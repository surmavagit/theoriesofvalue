            <h1>Theories of Value</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Theories of Value website!</p>
            <p>
                This is a knowledge base on <strong>Political Economy</strong>, as well as <strong>History</strong> and <strong>Philosophy</strong>,
                containing information on authors and books that I consider most important.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern authors will not be featured - this website will cover classical authors,
                whose works are in <strong>public domain</strong>, mostly authors that lived before the XX century.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will find some basic information on the authors themselves, on the main editions of their works,
                on some translations, as well as <strong>links to resources</strong> where you can read the books themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will try to add my own <strong>commentaries</strong> to authors and works, featured here, but it will take some time.
            </p>
